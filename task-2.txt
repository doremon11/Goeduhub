                                                                        Assignment/Task 2
1.Is a list mutable? 
  Yes,list is mutable.
  
2. Does a list need to be homogeneous?
  List can contain heterogeneous values such as integers, floats, strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries but they are commonly used to store collections of homogeneous objects
  
3. What is the difference between a list and a tuple.
  Tuple is also a sequence data type that can contain elements of different data types, but these are immutable in nature.Where as list is mutable.
  
4.How to find the number of elements in the list?
  By using len() funtion we can find Number of elements in the list.
  Syntax: len(list_name)

5.How to check whether the list is empty or not?
  if len(list_name)==0:
      print('list is empty')
  else:
      print('list is not empty')
6.How to find the first and last element of the list?
  By using indexing we can find first and last elements of list.
  first element - list_name[0]
  last element  - list_name[-1]
  
7.How to find the largest and lowest value in the list?
  By using min(),max() we can find lowest and largest elements of a list.
  lowest element - min(list_name)
  largest element  - max(list_name)
  
8.How to access elements of the list?
  By using indexing we can access the elements in list.
  ex: l=[1,2,3,4]
      print(l[0])
      output: 1
   
9.Remove elements in a list before a specific index
  del[a : b] : This method deletes all the elements in range starting from index 'a' till 'b' mentioned in arguments.

10.Remove elements in a list between 2 indices
   a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
   del a[::2]
   print(a)

11.Return every 2nd element in a list between 2 indices
   list_1=[1,2,3,4,5]
   print(list_1[::2])
12.Get the first element from each nested list in a list
   def Extract(lst)
       return [item[0] for item in lst]
   lst = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]] print(Extract(lst))
13.How to modify elements of the list?
   By using assignment operator'=' we can modify elements in list.

14.How to concatenate two lists?
   By using '+' operator we can concatenate two lists.
   
15.How to add two lists element-wise in python?
   list_1 = [1, 2, 3]
   list_2 = [4, 5, 6]    
   sum = []
   for (a,b) in zip(list1,list2):
        sum.append(a+b)
   print(sum)
16.Difference between del and clear?
   To remove items by index or slice we can use the del method in python .you can also remove elements from a list with del statements.   del list_name[index] or del list
clear() method in python is used to empty the entire list. this can be used if someone wants an empty list for any other purpose.  list_name.clear()

17.Difference between remove and pop?
   remove() delete the matching element/object whereas del and pop removes the element at a specific index. del and pop deals with the index.
   The only difference between the two is that- pop return deleted the value from the list and del does not return anything. Pop is the only way that returns the object
   
18. Difference between append and extend?
    append() adds a single element to the end of the list while . extend() can add multiple individual elements to the end of the list.
    
19.Difference between indexing and Slicing?
    Indexing: Indexing is used to obtain individual elements. Slicing: Slicing is used to obtain a sequence of elements.
    Indexing and Slicing can be be done in Python Sequences types like list, string, tuple, range objects.
    
20.Difference between sort and sorted?
    sort() function is very similar to sorted() but unlike sorted it returns nothing and makes changes to the original sequence.
    Moreover, sort() is a method of list class and can only be used with lists.
    sorted() method sorts the given sequence either in ascending order or in descending order and always return the a sorted list.
    This method doesnot effect the original sequence.
    
21.Difference between reverse and reversed?
   reverse() actually reverses the elements in the container. reversed() doesn't actually reverse anything, it merely returns an object
   that can be used to iterate over the container's elements in reverse order. 
   
22.Difference between copy and deepcopy?
    A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
    A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.
23.How to remove duplicate elements in the list?
   list_name=[1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4]
   s=set(list_name)
   print(s)
24.How to find an index of an element in the python list?
   By using index()funtion
   list_name.index(element)
25.How to find the occurrences of an element in the python list?
   By using count()funtion
   list_name.count(element)
26.How to insert an item at a given position?
    insert() method inserts the specified value at the specified position.
    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
    fruits.insert(1, "orange")
27.How to check if an item is in the list?
    l=[1,2,3,4,5]
    for i in l:
      if i==3:
         print('item is in the list')
      else:
         print('item not in the list')
         
28.How to flatten a list in python?
   # initializing the data and an empty list
  data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]
  flat_list = []
  # iterating over the data
  for item in data:
     # appending elements to the flat_list
      flat_list += item
   # printing the resultantn flat_list
   print(flat_list)

29.How to convert python list to other data structures like set, tuple, dictionary?
   typecasting to tuple can be done by using simply tuple(list_name)
   First create an iterator, and initialize it to variable ‘it’. Then use zip method, to zip keys and values together. Finally typecast it to dict type. 
30.How to apply a function to all items in the list?
  using map() meathod we can apply a funtion to all the elements in the list.
  
31.How to filter the elements based on a function in a python list?
   Python has a built-in function called filter() that allows you to filter a list (or a tuple) in a more beautiful way. 
   The filter() function iterates over the elements of the list and applies the fn() function to each element.
   It returns an iterator for the elements where the fn() returns True .

32.How python lists are stored in memory?
   Instead of storing values in the memory space reserved by the variable, Python has the variable refer to the value. 
   Similar to pointers in C, variables in Python refer to values (or objects) stored somewhere in memory.
   Python keeps an internal counter on how many references an object has.
